# esp-bridge-mcp-robot

A small desk-robot ("Pip"): an ESP32 with a 128×64 OLED shows **expressive
animated eyes** and is controlled either from **Claude Code** (via a built-in MCP
server, default) or by a **local Ollama** model chatting in the terminal. The
ESP32 is reached wirelessly over **Bluetooth** via
[python-esp-bridge](https://github.com/HamzaYslmn/python-esp-bridge) (a.k.a.
ESPBridge) — flash the board once, then everything runs in Python on your computer.

- **Face** — procedural animated eyes (PIL): 31 emotions + 24 gestures +
  8 looping activities, auto-blink and idle glances, on a background thread.
- **Autonomous pins** — tell Pip what's wired to which pin; it drives any pin
  (servos, LEDs, motors, buzzers, sensors) through tool calls. No per-device code.
- **Two control paths** — Claude Code over MCP (drives the face + pins via tools),
  or a local Ollama model that returns a structured reply
  (`{"response", "emotion", "gesture"}`) and calls the pin/activity tools.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| **A classic ESP32** dev board | The Bluetooth link needs a classic ESP32 (ESP-32S/D). On S3/C3/C6/H2 the bridge is USB-only, so wireless mode won't work. |
| **128×64 I²C OLED** | SSD1306 or SH1106 (the common 0.96″/1.3″ modules). |
| **A USB cable** | Only for the one-time firmware flash. After that, Bluetooth. |
| **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** | Python tooling (installs Python + deps). |
| Ollama *(optional)* | Only for local chat mode; not needed for Claude Code/MCP. |

### Wire the OLED to the ESP32

| OLED pin | ESP32 pin |
|---|---|
| VCC | 3V3 |
| GND | GND |
| SDA | GPIO **21** |
| SCL | GPIO **22** |

(Other pins are fine — set `ROBOT_OLED_SDA` / `ROBOT_OLED_SCL` in `.env` to match.)

## Setup

### 1. Install the project

```bash
uv sync
```

This installs the Python deps, including `python-esp-bridge[all]` — the Bluetooth
link, the OLED driver, the MCP server, and the firmware flasher (next step).

> Python 3.14 is pinned in `.python-version` (3.13+ also works).

### 2. Flash the ESPBridge firmware onto the ESP32 (once)

Pip talks to the board through ESPBridge firmware that must live on the ESP32.
You only do this **once** — afterwards the board is driven entirely from Python
over Bluetooth, no reflashing per project.

Plug the ESP32 in over **USB**, then flash the prebuilt firmware straight from the
host — no Arduino IDE needed. `uv sync` already pulled the flasher in (it ships in
`python-esp-bridge[all]`), so just run it; it lists the serial ports, you pick one,
and it writes the bundled image:

```bash
uv run espbridge flash           # lists ports, pick one, writes the firmware
uv run espbridge flash --erase   # wipe the whole flash first (clears stored name/NVS)
```

> Prefer not to install the project first? Flash straight from PyPI with uvx:
> `uvx --from "python-esp-bridge[flash]" espbridge flash`

<details>
<summary>Prefer to build it yourself? (Arduino IDE)</summary>

Install the **"python esp bridge"** library (Library Manager → search
*python esp bridge*), open *File → Examples → python esp bridge → Bridge*, set the
partition scheme to **Huge APP**, and click **Upload**. The whole sketch is one line:

```cpp
EspBridge.begin();              // default Bluetooth password: "espbridge"
// EspBridge.begin("yourpass"); // ...or set your own
```
</details>

The default firmware uses the Bluetooth password **`espbridge`**.

### 3. Verify the link and configure `.env`

Unplug USB (the board runs on its own power now) and confirm the host can reach it
over Bluetooth — this prints the chip, MAC, and capabilities:

```bash
uv run espbridge info         # uses password "espbridge" by default
```

Then create your config from the template:

```bash
cp src/.env.example src/.env
```

The defaults already match the default firmware (password `espbridge`, auto-pick
the first board). Only edit `src/.env` if you changed the firmware password or
have several boards:

```ini
ROBOT_PASSWORD=espbridge      # must match your EspBridge.begin(...)
ROBOT_BLE_TARGET=             # empty = first board; or a board name / MAC
```

> **Optional — faster, deterministic connects:** name the board `pip` and pin its
> MAC into `src/.env` with `uv run src/modules/espbridge/setup_board.py`. Handy if
> you have more than one bridge nearby.

### 4. (Chat mode only) install an Ollama model

Skip this if you're driving Pip from Claude Code.

```bash
ollama pull qwen3.5:4b
```

## Run

The mode is set by `ROBOT_MCP` in `.env` (default `true`).

```bash
uv run src/main.py                # default: MCP server — drive Pip from Claude Code
uv run src/main.py demo           # interactive menu: play any mood/gesture/activity
uv run src/main.py --no-display   # run with no board attached (just the engine)
```

- **Claude Code (MCP, default):** the repo ships a `.mcp.json` that registers
  `pip-robot`, so just **open this folder in Claude Code and approve the server**
  when prompted — see below.
- **Local Ollama chat:** set `ROBOT_MCP=false` in `.env`, then `uv run src/main.py`
  and talk to Pip in the terminal.

### Use Pip as a Claude Code tool

**Inside this repo:** opening the folder is enough — Claude Code auto-detects the
checked-in `.mcp.json` and asks you to trust the `pip-robot` server.

**In any other project — no checkout, one command.** Pip ships a `pip-robot`
console script, so [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) can run it
straight from GitHub in a throwaway environment:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio --env ROBOT_MCP=true --scope user pip-robot \
  -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/HamzaYslmn/esp-bridge-mcp-robot pip-robot
```

That registers this `.mcp.json` for **every** project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pip-robot": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/HamzaYslmn/esp-bridge-mcp-robot", "pip-robot"],
      "env": { "ROBOT_MCP": "true" }
    }
  }
}
```

The defaults match the default firmware (password `espbridge`, auto-pick the
first board). To override — a custom password, a specific board, different OLED
pins — add them to the `env` block (`ROBOT_PASSWORD`, `ROBOT_BLE_TARGET`,
`ROBOT_OLED_SDA`/`_SCL`; see the table below) or drop a `.env` next to where the
server launches. uvx caches the build; `uvx --refresh ...` pulls the latest.

**Prefer the local checkout?** Register the repo copy instead — handy while
hacking on the eyes, since edits take effect with no reinstall:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio --env ROBOT_MCP=true --scope project pip-robot \
  -- uv run src/main.py
```

`--scope project` writes to `.mcp.json` (shared, checked into git); `--scope user`
makes Pip available in every project; `--scope local` is a personal, un-committed
entry. Reset a trust choice with `claude mcp reset-project-choices`.

**Pip reacts as Claude works.** Claude Code calls the `set_face` / `set_activity`
MCP tools directly while it codes — no hooks, no side-channel. Those two tools are
pre-allowed in `.claude/settings.json` so the face never stalls on a permission
prompt:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["mcp__pip-robot__set_face", "mcp__pip-robot__set_activity"]
  }
}
```

The pin/`notify` tools are left out on purpose — Claude asks before moving
hardware. Add `"mcp__pip-robot__*"` if you want to pre-approve everything.

## Configuration (`.env`, defaults in `.env.example`)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ROBOT_MCP` | `true` | `true` = MCP server, `false` = Ollama chat |
| `ROBOT_MODEL` | `qwen3.5:4b` | Ollama model (chat mode) |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server |
| `ROBOT_BLE_TARGET` | _(auto)_ | Board name or MAC (empty = first board) |
| `ROBOT_PASSWORD` | `espbridge` | Firmware Bluetooth password (`EspBridge.begin(...)`) |
| `ROBOT_OLED_SDA` / `_SCL` | `21` / `22` | OLED I²C pins |
| `ROBOT_FPS` | `24` | Eye frame rate |
| `ROBOT_BRIGHTNESS` | `255` | OLED brightness cap 0–255 (moods like `standby` dim below it) |

## Extending

Add a tool in `build_tools` (new hardware), or a new expression — an emotion in
`eyes/moods.py`, a gesture in `eyes/gestures.py`, an activity in
`eyes/activities.py` (one line each). **Both control paths pick it up with no
extra wiring:** Claude Code sees the new tool/vocabulary over MCP, and the Ollama
brain auto-derives its emotion/gesture choices from the same lists (and calls the
activity tool) — so a new face works in both modes the moment you add it.

Regenerate the showcase GIF above (every mood, gesture and activity) with
`uv run docs/make_gif.py`.

## Troubleshooting

- **No board found / connection fails** — make sure you flashed the firmware
  (step 2), the board is powered, and `ROBOT_PASSWORD` matches your firmware.
  `uv run espbridge info` should connect and print the chip/MAC.
- **Wireless doesn't work at all** — confirm it's a *classic* ESP32; S3/C3/C6/H2
  build the bridge USB-only.
- **Blank OLED** — check the SDA/SCL wiring matches `ROBOT_OLED_SDA`/`_SCL`.
- **Bluetooth dropped mid-session** — Pip self-heals: the next frame reopens the
  link and the face resumes once the board is back (no restart needed). If it stays
  dark, the board lost power or is out of range — power it and it reconnects within
  a few seconds.
- **`uv sync` fails on a wheel** — a dependency may lack a wheel for your Python;
  `uv python pin 3.13 && uv sync` falls back to a version that has one.
