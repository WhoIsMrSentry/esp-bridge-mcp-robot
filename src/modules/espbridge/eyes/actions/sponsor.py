"""A thank-you screen -- an inverted GitHub Sponsors QR with Pip's kawaii face -- "sponsor".

A looping action: set_activity('sponsor') and Pip shows a QR linking to
https://github.com/sponsors/HamzaYslmn with the kawaii face (round eyes, blush, twinkles)
resized into the free right half. The QR is baked in (the URL never changes) so eyes/ keeps
no encoder dependency.

It's drawn inverted -- lit on a black screen -- so it's dim (kind to the OLED) and the black
field around the code is the quiet zone, so no white border is needed and it fills the screen.
Inverted codes scan on modern phones (iOS/Android). Regenerate _QR if the URL changes:
    uv run --with segno python -c "import segno
    for r in segno.make('<url>', error='l').matrix:
        print(hex(sum(v<<c for c,v in enumerate(r))))"
