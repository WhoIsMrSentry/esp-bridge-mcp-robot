"""Decorative looping animations -- a vibe just *plays out*: it shows no task status and no live
data, it's pure scenery (a campfire, the matrix rain, pixel-sand decay). Mechanically these ARE
actions (see spec.Vibe); they live here so the menu/showcase can group eye-candy apart from
real activities. Add one: drop `<name>.py` exposing `VIBE = Vibe(...)`, then slot its name into
the curated order below."""
